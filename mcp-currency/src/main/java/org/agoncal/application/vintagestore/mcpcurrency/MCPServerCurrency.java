This comprehensive risk management tool identifies transaction exposure, translation exposure, and economic exposure across all foreign currency positions. It quantifies potential P&L impacts under various exchange rate scenarios, calculates Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for currency portfolios, performs stress testing under extreme market conditions, and analyzes natural hedges within the organization's operations. The tool recommends optimal hedging ratios, compares hedging instruments including forwards, options, swaps, and currency futures, evaluates hedging costs versus benefits, suggests dynamic hedging strategies that adjust to market conditions, and provides documentation for hedge accounting under IFRS and US GAAP. It incorporates cash flow forecasting, netting opportunities across subsidiaries, and centralized treasury optimization. Essential for CFOs, treasury managers, risk officers, and institutional investors managing significant foreign currency exposure.",
